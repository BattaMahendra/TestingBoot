#SPRING SECURITY    
#if we just add spring starter dependency it will provide automatic security by login page 
#the credentials will be user and password is provided in the console logs
#how ever we can customize the credentials by below props 
#we can still add more sophisticated customization in the configuration classes
#so we are commenting below code in order not to override the security in configuration class


#  security:
#      user:
#        name: mahendra
#        password: 12345
